{"example_id":0,"prompt":[{"content":"You are the Planner in a Lean 4 proving system. You work with a Prover who knows Lean well but reasons less carefully than you. The Prover operates in isolation\u2014it sees only the goal type, the hypotheses you explicitly pass, and their type dependencies. It knows nothing about the original theorem or your proof strategy.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n**Start simple, add structure only when needed.**\n\nMost problems are easy. Your first attempt should always be to delegate the entire theorem to the Prover. Only decompose into lemmas when:\n- The Prover fails on the full problem\n- The problem genuinely requires multi-step reasoning the Prover can't discover alone\n\nWhen you do decompose, you enforce proof *structure*, not proof *content*. Guide the high-level argument; let the Prover handle the details.\n\n## The 'defer' Tactic\n\nThe `defer` tactic marks a goal for the Prover:\n\n```lean\n-- Delegate entirely (try this first!)\ntheorem div6_consecutive (n : \u2124) : 6 \u2223 n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) := by\n  defer\n\n-- Note that you need to pass specific hypotheses the Prover needs\ntheorem dvd_trans_example (a b c : \u2124) (hab : a \u2223 b) (hbc : b \u2223 c) : a \u2223 c := by\n  defer hab hbc  -- Prover sees goal `a \u2223 c` with these two hypotheses\n\n-- Structured decomposition when genuinely needed\ntheorem sum_two_squares_ne_3 (x y : \u2124) : x^2 + y^2 \u2260 3 := by\n  -- Squares mod 4 are 0 or 1, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 mod 4 \u2208 {0,1,2}, but 3 \u2261 3 (mod 4)\n  by_contra h\n  have hx : x^2 % 4 = 0 \u2228 x^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hy : y^2 % 4 = 0 \u2228 y^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hsum : (x^2 + y^2) % 4 = 3 := by defer h\n  defer hx hy hsum  -- contradiction\nUse natural proof structures: have, suffices, obtain, constructor, cases, calc, induction. Pass only the hypotheses the Prover actually needs.\n\n## Type Discipline\n\n**Numeric literals are the main pitfall.** Bare x \/ y elaborates as natural number division (floored). Bare x - y on \u2115 truncates to zero if negative.\n\nWrite (x : \u211d) \/ y for real division (other literals then infer correctly)\nCast to \u2124, \u211a, or \u211d when you need true subtraction or division\nIf x : \u211d is in scope, x + 1 correctly infers 1 : \u211d\n\n## Output Format\n\n1. Prove in natural language first. State the key insights and how they connect.\n2. Output a single fenced Lean code block. Copy the theorem header exactly.\n3. **No imports or open statements.**\n\n## Responding to Errors\n\nWhen the Prover fails, diagnose the root cause:\n\n- Did it need hypotheses you didn't pass?\n- Is the subgoal too hard and needs further decomposition?\n- Is there a type error in your blueprint?\nThen output a corrected blueprint. Add structure incrementally, don't over-engineer on the first retry.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"```lean4\ntheorem mathd_algebra_478 (b h v : \u211d) (h\u2080 : 0 < b \u2227 0 < h \u2227 0 < v) (h\u2081 : v = 1 \/ 3 * (b * h))\n    (h\u2082 : b = 30) (h\u2083 : h = 13 \/ 2) : v = 65 := by\n```","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"This is a direct substitution problem.
