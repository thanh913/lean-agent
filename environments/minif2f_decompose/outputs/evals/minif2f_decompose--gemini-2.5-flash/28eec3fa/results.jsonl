{"example_id":0,"prompt":[{"content":"You are the Planner in a Lean 4 proving system. You work alongside a Prover: you design high-level proof blueprints, and the Prover fills in low-level Lean tactics. Your job is to enforce proof structure (cases, helper lemmas, reductions) while delegating the technical details.\n\n## Blueprint Requirements\nAttempt **incrementally** at designing a high-level Lean 4 proof (blueprint) for the Prover to fill up the low-level details.\nRequirements:\n1. If first attempt: **Always** use a single `defer` for the entire goal.\n2. If failure: From environment's feedback, diagnose the root cause from the error, then introduce *just enough* structure to fix it.\n3. Repeat until the proof succeeds.\n\nTo submit a blueprint, you must use the `<blueprint>...<\/blueprint>` tag. Inside that tag, include a single fenced `lean4` code block with your current blueprint. Example:\n\n<blueprint>\n```lean4\ntheorem NAME (binders) : GOAL := by\n  -- your use of `defer` goes here\n  defer\n```\n<\/blueprint>\n\n## The `defer` Interface\nSyntax: `defer h\u2081 h\u2082 ... h\u2099`\n\nHands the current goal in scope goal to the Prover, who sees only the goal plus the listed hypotheses (and their type dependencies). Pass only what is logically required.\n```lean\n-- First attempt: defer the whole goal.\ntheorem div6_consecutive (n : \u2124) : 6 \u2223 n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) := by\n  defer\n\n-- Pass hypotheses the goal depends on (dependencies like `b` are included automatically).\ntheorem dvd_trans_example (a b c : \u2124) (hab : a \u2223 b) (hbc : b \u2223 c) : a \u2223 c := by\n  defer hab hbc\n\n-- Decomposition after a failed first attempt:\ntheorem sum_two_squares_ne_3 (x y : \u2124) : x^2 + y^2 \u2260 3 := by\n  by_contra h\n  have hx : x^2 % 4 = 0 \u2228 x^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hy : y^2 % 4 = 0 \u2228 y^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hsum : (x^2 + y^2) % 4 = 3 := by defer h\n  defer hx hy hsum\n```\n\nNatural structures to use: `have`, `suffices`, `obtain`, `constructor`, `cases`, `induction`, and `calc`. Limit yourself to at most eight subgoals per plan.\n\n## Type Discipline\n- Numeric literals default to `\u2115`. Cast the first literal when working over `\u2124`, `\u211a`, or `\u211d`.\n- `(5 : \u2115) - 7 = 0`; cast to `\u2124` first when real subtraction is needed.\n- `(7 : \u2124) \/ 2 = 3`; use `\u211a` or `\u211d` when you need exact division.\n- Once a variable has type `\u211d`, `x + 1` and similar expressions pick up the right literal type automatically.\n\n## Answer Format:\nFirst, write from first principles a proof of the theorem, so as to refer to in later turns. After that, iterate turn-by-turn on the blueprint following the \"Blueprint Requirements\".\n","role":"system"},{"content":"```lean4\ntheorem mathd_algebra_484 : Real.log 27 \/ Real.log 3 = 3 := by\n```","role":"user"}],"completion":[{"content":"Here's a first-principles proof of the theorem:\nWe want to prove `Real.log 27 \/ Real.log 3 = 3`.\n\n1.  **Rewrite 27**: Observe that `27 = 3^3`.\n2.  **Apply logarithm property**: Using the logarithm property `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`, we can write `Real.log 27` as `Real.log (3^3) = 3 * Real.log 3`.\n3.  **Substitute into the expression**: Substitute this back into the original equation:\n    `(3 * Real.log 3) \/ Real.log 3 = 3`\n4.  **Simplify**: We need to ensure that `Real.log 3` is not zero to perform the division. Since `3 > 1`, `Real.log 3` is strictly positive, and thus `Real.log 3 \u2260 0`.\n5.  Therefore, we can cancel `Real.log 3` from the numerator and denominator:\n    `3 = 3`\nThis concludes the proof.\n\n---\n\n<blueprint>\n```lean4\ntheorem mathd_algebra_484 : Real.log 27 \/ Real.log 3 = 3 := by\n  defer\n```\n<\/blueprint>","role":"assistant"},{"content":"<REPL>Plan compiled but some subgoals failed.
