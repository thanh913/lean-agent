This reveals that `y(x)` is of the form `A * cos(x) - B * sin(x)`, where `A` and `B` are constants depending on the `a\u1d62`.\n\nThe conditions `y(m) = 0` and `y(n) = 0` form a system of two linear equations in `A` and `B`. For this system to have a non-trivial solution for `(A, B)`, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This directly leads to the conclusion that `sin(m - n) = 0`, which implies `m - n` is an integer multiple of `\u03c0`.\n\nThe only remaining piece is to show that the solution `(A, B)` must be non-trivial (i.e., `A` and `B` are not both zero). This is the most subtle part of the proof. We can show `A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 > 0` by interpreting `A` and `B` as the real and imaginary parts of a complex sum `S = \u2211 (exp(i a\u2096) \/ 2\u1d4f)`. Using the triangle inequality on this complex sum, we can show that `|S| > 0` because the first term has modulus 1, while the sum of the moduli of the remaining terms is strictly less than 1.\n\n```lean\ntheorem imo_1969_p2 (m n : \u211d) (k : \u2115) (a : \u2115 \u2192 \u211d) (y : \u211d \u2192 \u211d) (h\u2080 : 0 < k)\n    (h\u2081 : \u2200 x, y x = \u2211 i in Finset.range k, Real.cos (a i + x) \/ 2 ^ i) (h\u2082 : y m = 0)\n    (h\u2083 : y n = 0) : \u2203 t : \u2124, m - n = t * Real.pi := by\n  -- Rewrite y(x) as A * cos(x) - B * sin(x)\n  let A := \u2211 i in Finset.range k, Real.cos (a i) \/ 2 ^ i\n  let B := \u2211 i in Finset.range k, Real.sin (a i) \/ 2 ^ i\n  have y_form : \u2200 x, y x = A * Real.cos x - B * Real.sin x := by\n    defer h\u2081 a\n\n  -- Show that A and B are not both zero.

{"example_id":7,"prompt":[{"content":"You are the Planner in a Lean 4 proving system. Your job is to write a rigorous proof sketch, then translate it into a structured blueprint the Prover can execute.\nAbout the Prover: It knows Lean well but reasons less carefully than you. It operates in isolation--seeing only the goal type, the hypotheses you explicitly pass, and their type dependencies. It knows nothing about the original theorem or your proof strategy.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nStart simple, add structure only when needed.\n\nMost problems are easy. Your first attempt should always be to delegate the entire theorem to the Prover with a single `defer`. Only decompose into lemmas when this fails.\n\nWhen you do decompose, you enforce proof structure, not proof content. Guide the high-level argument; let the Prover handle the details. Avoid micromanaging Lean syntax.\n\n\n## Input\n\nYou will receive:\n1. A theorem statement (possibly with surrounding context)\n2. Optionally, Prover error messages from a previous attempt\n\nExample:\n\n```\ntheorem div6_consecutive (n : Z) : 6 | n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) := by sorry\n```\n\n\n## The `defer` Tactic\n\n`defer` marks a goal for the Prover to solve in isolation.\n\nSyntax: `defer [hyp1 hyp2 ...]`\n\nWhat the Prover receives:\n- The current goal type\n- The listed hypotheses and their transitive type dependencies\n- Nothing else--no theorem name, no surrounding context\n\nWhat you must pass:\n- Hypotheses whose statements are needed (not just those whose types appear in the goal)\n- Local `have` bindings the subproof relies on\n\nExamples:\n\n```lean\n-- Delegate entirely (try this first!)\ntheorem div6_consecutive (n : Z) : 6 | n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) := by\n  defer\n\n-- Pass hypotheses the Prover needs\ntheorem dvd_trans_example (a b c : Z) (hab : a | b) (hbc : b | c) : a | c := by\n  defer hab hbc\n\n-- Structured decomposition when simple delegation fails\ntheorem sum_two_squares_ne_3 (x y : Z) : x^2 + y^2 != 3 := by\n  -- Squares mod 4 are 0 or 1, so x^2 + y^2 mod 4 in {0,1,2}, but 3 = 3 (mod 4)\n  by_contra h\n  have hx : x^2 % 4 = 0 \\\/ x^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hy : y^2 % 4 = 0 \\\/ y^2 % 4 = 1 := by defer\n  have hsum : (x^2 + y^2) % 4 = 3 := by defer h\n  -- Goal: False (derive contradiction from hx, hy, hsum)\n  defer hx hy hsum\n```\n\nUse natural proof structures: `have`, `suffices`, `obtain`, `constructor`, `cases`, `calc`, `induction`. Pass only the hypotheses the Prover actually needs.\n\n\n## Choosing Hypotheses\n\nInclude a hypothesis if:\n- It is mentioned in the goal by name (e.g., proving `P h` requires `h`)\n- It provides structural information the Prover cannot infer (divisibility, bounds, etc.)\n\nOmit a hypothesis if:\n- It is only used to derive something you are already passing as a `have`\n- It is a typeclass instance (Prover has access to instance search)\n\n\n## Type Discipline\n\nNumeric literals are the main pitfall.\n\nNatural subtraction truncates: `(5 : N) - 7 = 0`\n  Fix: Cast to Z before subtracting.\n\nInteger division floors: `(7 : Z) \/ 2 = 3`\n  Fix: Use Q or R for true division.\n\nBare literals default to N: `x \/ y` with `x y : N` is floored.\n  Fix: Write `(x : R) \/ y` for real division.\n\nRule of thumb: If the statement involves fractions or negative numbers, ascribe the first term explicitly. Once `x : R` is in scope, `x + 1` correctly infers `1 : R`.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\n1. Proof sketch (outside the code block): State the key mathematical insight. This is for your own reasoning and will not be seen by the Prover.\n\n2. (Only) If this is the turn where you refine the plan, list all subgoals, and explain the rationale behind.\n\n3. Lean blueprint (single fenced code block):\n   - Copy the theorem header exactly\n   - No `import` or `open` statements\n   - Use `defer` for subgoals\n\nExample output:\n\nThe product of three consecutive integers is divisible by both 2 and 3.
