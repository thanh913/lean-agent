I will now break down the proof according to the mathematical argument. The core idea is to rewrite `10000!` by separating the product into its even and odd terms. This will allow us to relate `10000!` to the product of odd numbers (the left-hand side of the equation) and the product of even numbers. We will then show that the product of even numbers simplifies to `2^5000 * 5000!`, which will lead to the desired result.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Rephrase the goal `LHS = 10000! \/ (2^5000 * 5000!)` into the equivalent form `10000! = LHS * (2^5000 * 5000!)`, which is more convenient for proofs involving natural number arithmetic.\n2.  Express `10000!` as the product of integers from 1 to 10000.\n3.  Split this product into the product of even numbers and the product of odd numbers in the range [1, 10000].\n4.  Show that the product of odd numbers in `Finset.Icc 1 10000` is the same as the product of odd numbers in `Finset.range 10000` (the LHS).\n5.
